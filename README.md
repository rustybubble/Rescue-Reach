# Rescue-Reach
Rescue Reach is a prototype drone system that uses AI-powered video analysis to detect rip currents and struggling swimmers in real time. It alerts lifeguards instantly and can autonomously deploy a flotation device to assist before help arrives.

We created Rescue Reach after learning how deadly and unpredictable rip currents can be, especially when lifeguards donâ€™t spot them in time. We wanted to build a tool that could save lives by providing lifeguards with a tool that can monitor many miles of beach.
