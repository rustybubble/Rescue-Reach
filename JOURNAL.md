**Total logged hours: 60+ (design, code, training, outreach, competitions)**  
- All mechanical CAD built in Onshape, full system modeled in Blender.  
- AI inference run on YOLOv8 + simulated beach environments

# March 20th: The idea was born  
While talking with Captain Butch Arbin, a veteran lifeguard in Ocean City, Maryland, we learned just how common‚Äîand deadly‚Äîrip currents are.

We then thought of a concept that could:
- Use computer vision to detect rip currents  
- Alert lifeguards via a live interface  
- Drop a flotation ring automatically  

We named the system: **Rescue Reach**.

**Total time spent: 3h**

# March 28th: CAD begins in Onshape  
Started modeling the payload drop system in Onshape. Specs were designed around the DJI Mini.

# April 4th: AI model
Found image classification model on RoboFlow that detects rip-currents and works pretty fast.
Tested it to see if it works. https://universe.roboflow.com/hrw/rip-rm14s

# April 12th: Beta web UI + model test  
Designed a simulated interface for lifeguards using HTML. When a ‚Äúrip current‚Äù is detected, the interface displays:
- Drone GPS  
- Rip zone bounding box  
- Action buttons: Satellite Mode, Drone View, Verification, Broadcast Instructions, Life Preserver Drop, True Rip Current, False Alarm, Download/Send Images

**Total time spent: 5h**

# April 20th: Follow-up with Captain Butch  
Reconnected with Captain Butch Arbin to show our progress. He liked the concept and encouraged testing at rip-current-prone beaches like Playa Zipolite and Panama City Beach.

Feedback from a Delaware lifeguard:
- Interface must be easy to learn  
- Lifeguards shouldn‚Äôt need drone training  
- Alerts should be loud and visual  

That feedback shaped our lifeguard dashboard design.

**Total time spent: 3h**

# May 14th: Product Page  
Created a website for investors/competition judges to view our project.

# May 23rd: Pitch video production for competitions
Made a 5 minute pitch video with:
- Narration  
- Surf visuals  
- Overlay UI elements

# May 29th: Competitions + awards  
- **2025 Paradigm Challenge Finalist**  
- **Top 10 at University of the District of Columbia Capital Cup**

**Total time spent: 4h**

---

# July 5th: Outreach + funding search  
Contacted several organizations:
- NOAA Wakefield  
- Assateague State Park  
- WebCOOS  

Mr. Scott Schumann responded positively and offered to connect us with surf zone forecasters and lifeguards.

Began researching:
- NOAA SBIR  
- NSF I-Corps Microgrant  
- BOEM Environmental R&D Fund

**Total time spent: 5h**
